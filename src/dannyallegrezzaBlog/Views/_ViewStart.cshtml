@* The _ViewStartView.cshtml is a special view that gets run before every single view in the site, and it's in this page that you can put any common logic such as setting the layout property for every page in the site. To implement the view start view, simply add a new file to your Views folder named _ViewStart.cshtml. Note that this time, the underscore actually does matter in the Razor view name. So be sure to use it. Once you have this file in place, you can simply cut and paste the layout property from the index page and into this page.  *@
@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}
